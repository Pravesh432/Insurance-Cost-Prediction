# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
using Regression Algorithms of Machine Learning I want to determine the yearly insurance of persons.


# Problem Statement: 
###  In this dataset we're going to use information like a person's age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills. 
###  This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. 

# About the Dataset:
- The dataset consists of 8 feature columns and 1338 rows. In this dataset we want to predict on numeric value Charges output.
